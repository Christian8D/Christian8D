I am a dynamic and entrepreneurial Digital Nomad, passionate about working with businesses globally to transform solutions and drive scale through technology and digital platforms.

I feel at home online and love technology, naturally fitting into Software Development , Web Design and Digital Marketing for work - all in all I am a driven developer with a passion for coding. 

As the demand and need to assist mid-size entrepreneurial companies increased, my vision to establish international services with creative and simple concepts fit assisting clients and partners in developing ideas and strategies to amplify what they already do best or help build it up.
